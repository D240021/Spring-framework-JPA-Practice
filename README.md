<h2 align="center">Project description</h2>
<p>The project is a Music Management System built using Spring Framework with JPA (Java Persistence API) for database interaction. It focuses on managing a collection of songs and singers, allowing users to perform CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on both entities. The system uses a Many-to-Many relationship between songs and singers, with a join table for mapping their association.

Key features include:

-Adding, updating, and deleting songs and singers.
-Assigning multiple singers to a song and vice versa.
-Fetching and displaying data using eager/lazy loading.
-Handling exceptions with custom exception classes.
This project is designed for practice with entity relationships, JPA annotations, and the integration of Spring services and repositories.</p>
